# About me

My name is Andi Putra Wijaya. I'm an undergraduate college student currently pursuing diploma on informatics in [Bandung State Polytechnic](https://www.polban.ac.id/). My carreer is mostly related on backend programming using a couple language such as Golang, typescript and php. I also casually program in C usually for fun, usually on non trivial matter.
